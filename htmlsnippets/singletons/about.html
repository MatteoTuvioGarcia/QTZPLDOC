        <p class="text-dark">QTZPL is a program aiming to make
            working with and visualizing ZPL code less of a pain
            in the butt, and as such, making it more accessible
            to the common programmer.</p>
        <p class="text-dark"> Please note that the program is currently in its beta state and is subject to change at
            any time, I'll try to keep this documentation up-to-date. Emphasis on try.</p>
